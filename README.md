# TODO

Next steps:

- Add a breadcrumb
- Redirect on wrong language
- Decrease title size on low resolutions
- use [lucide-solid](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/tree/main/packages/lucide-solid) once [https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8237](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8237) is solved

- Hydration errors: [https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/issues/881](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/issues/881)
