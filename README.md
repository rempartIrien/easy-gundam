# TODO

Next steps:

- `margin-left` => `margin-inline-start`
- CSP
- update favicon and add manifest
- use [lucide-solid](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/tree/main/packages/lucide-solid) once [https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8237](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8237) is solved
- Fix scrollbar jumps: [https://aykevl.nl/2014/09/fix-jumping-scrollbar](https://aykevl.nl/2014/09/fix-jumping-scrollbar). For now we just do it on the whole app, this is not good, we need to do it on header + content + footer to keep backgrounds color. Also see [this](https://github.com/kobaltedev/kobalte/issues/107) and [this](https://github.com/kobaltedev/kobalte/issues/243) from Kobalte repo.
