# TODO

Next steps:

- define layout
- rework header
- allow dynamic component for Text and maybe Heading
- switch to `@graphql-codegen/client-preset`
- Rework the way markdown strings are rendered
- use [lucide-solid](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/tree/main/packages/lucide-solid) once [https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8237](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8237) is solved
