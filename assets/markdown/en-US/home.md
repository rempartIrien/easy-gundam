I guess you're checking this website during a recruitment process.

Despite the site still is under construction and misses content, here are a few things you can check:

- a timeline chronology page [example](../timelines/UC/series)
- a series overview page [example](../timelines/UC/series/UC)
- a series insights page [example](../timelines/UC/series/UC/insights)
- locale mangement (with opt-in cookie in case you land at site root `/`)
- system, light and dark themes mangement (with opt-in cookie)
- responsive design (mobile first) with breakpoints and `srcset` for images
- cookie management [page](../cookies)

Don't forget, the code is on [Github](https://github.com/rempartIrien/easy-gundam).
